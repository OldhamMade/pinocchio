'nose' patches:

 -- multihome -w
 -- PRIORITY stuff
 -- a way to get a 'canonical' name for a module, class, function, method.
    (e.g. my 'fullname' stuff)

Other ideas:

 -- summary, which drops out lists of failed tests etc in a nice format;
 -- runonly, to run only the tests in summary format
 -- capture, which captures stdout for each test into a separate
    file
 -- history, keeps track of history & finds sporadically failing tests
 -- path-mangler, which would just be a straight ol' python module
    for (guess what?) mangling sys.path
