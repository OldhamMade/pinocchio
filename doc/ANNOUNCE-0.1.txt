ANNOUNCING pinocchio v0.1.

pinocchio is a collection of plugins for the 'nose' unit testing framework;
more about that here:

     http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/

Basic documentation for pinocchio is available at

     http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/pinocchio/doc/

pinocchio currently contains five plugins:

  * decorator -- allows you to assign tags to tests from a list file;

  * figleafsections -- shows you which tests are executing what code;

  * stopwatch -- lets you pick tests to run based on the last execution time;

  * outputsave -- saves test stdout into individual files, tagged with
	       success/failure.

  * spec -- generates "specification" output from test class/method names.

This is the first package release of pinocchio.

Note that pinocchio *requires* setuptools to be installed, because that
is how nose plugins work!

You can install pinocchio with easy_install, or download this release at
